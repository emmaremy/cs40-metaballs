# Metaballs

This is Rachel Diamond and Emma Remy's final project for CS40: Computer Graphics with Dr. Andrew Danner in fall 2016. It is an implementation of 3-dimensional metaballs using OpenGL. For a more detailed description of our implementation process, please look at our final [writeup.md](https://github.com/emmaremy/cs40-metaballs/blob/main/writeup.md).
